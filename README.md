# Coffee Website

This is a simple **React**-based frontend website designed for a Brazilian coffee roaster. It showcases coffee-related content and allows users to explore the coffee menu, learn more about the roaster, and get in touch with the company. This project is purely a frontend application with no backend or full-stack functionality.

P.s. The website is all in portuguese language.
